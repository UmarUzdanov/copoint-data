    content: `Lots of talk about data these days. Even Warren Buffet, who is notorious for avoiding IPOs, is getting in on the action. Plenty of consultancies and product companies are encouraging organizations to leverage data: Build a lake, leverage AI, get some machines to do some learning (ML). Getting data is just one piece of the challenge. You may even find a nugget that proves super valuable, and you are still no where near the finish line. Not many delve into the difficulty of implementing recommendations that come from untapped data.

Rather than focusing on how much data you have or could have, it may make more sense to focus on what you could or more importantly, would do with data you do not have today. What business outcome do you want to drive? Without this key piece of information and buy in from leadership, all that data could go unused.

If you approached the leadership team of your organization and said, "if we spend an extra 5 cents on every sale, I can guarantee we will get an extra $5 from the customer," how many of you would have an easy time making that pitch? On surface, it seems so simple, spend 5 cents and get 500 cents in return. That is a 9,900% ROI.

Implementation is not so simple. First, you have to get the 5 cents from somewhere (harder to do these days than ever). Second, you have to sell the idea internally â€“ there will be plenty of healthy and probably some not so healthy skepticism. Third, you have to actually implement. Fourth, you have to measure. And finally, you need to prove the results. Many data driven efforts do not make it past step 1. Most do not make it past step 2.

What are your thoughts about the data conversation these days? Should you go out and get all the data you can and then figure out what you are going to do with it at a later date?`,

    content: `I am sure you have read the articles claiming all companies are now data or technology companies. With the proliferation of generative AI, cloud technologies, and the reduced cost of storage, information is plentiful, readily accessible, and often overwhelming. Companies have more information than they can handle. Filtering through it all and getting to the data that really matters is more difficult today than it has ever been. As a result, many C-level executives sponsor data related projects to create focused dashboards and data warehouses with the information they need to guide strategic business decisions.

Whether building a data platform for the first time or replacing an aging platform, starting with a data strategy will greatly assist in the process. Most organizations realize a data strategy is critical but few take the time to consider the components of a strategy before initiating large scale, complex data warehousing projects.

Throughout the years, we have amassed best practices we find immensely helpful when creating data strategies. The following are five best practices that drive success:

1. Involve executives early and often. Throughout a data strategy project, involve the executives early. Ensure a project sponsor who actively needs the data (and ideally funds the project) is involved in steering project direction. This will avoid creating a platform with data that does not really drive business value from day one.

2. Business Questions NOT data sources. Create a list of business questions you want answered by the platform, NOT a list of data sources you want integrated into the platform.

3. Less is more. Do not cram every piece of data you can find into the new platform. Identify the business questions you want answered (see above) and select data sources based on business value. The notion of Big Data forced many organizations to lose sight of the questions they wanted answered and simply take a "get everything" approach.

4. Useful and usable reports. Our research shows that only 20% of reports in legacy platforms are used. Recreating the other 80% in the new platform wastes precious resources. Create a list of existing and desired reports. Weed out redundant and obsolete reports, prioritize the remainder, then implement the 20% first.

5. Clean the data. Towards the end of the data strategy effort, kick off a pre-build activity to cleanse data sources. Reports are only useful if the source data is accurate and meaningful. Bad data = bad reports.

Do you have any additional thoughts on data strategies? We would love to hear from you.

    content: `The promise of AI is a topic that continues to spark discussions among professionals. Conversations with friends, customers, and colleagues have highlighted the crucial role of data in unlocking the true potential of artificial intelligence. These comments come from a half a dozen meetings this week with folks in my network.

To harness the benefits of AI effectively, here are three considerations when embarking on an AI project.

1. Establish a robust data governance office to oversee data access, location, and normalization processes.
2. Initiate a datalake project to consolidate disparate data sources within your organization, utilizing tools like Microsoft Fabric to structure data for machine learning applications.
3. Prioritize advanced analytics as an initial step post-datalake implementation. This approach allows for both programmatic analysis and visual representation through platforms like Power BI.

Securing early successes in these areas not only provides your team with confidence but also creates a foundation for extracting valuable insights from future AI initiatives centered around data.

    content: `Now that you have a solid data strategy in place, you will likely start down the path of building a solution (a data warehouse, a business intelligence tool, a reporting platform, or even an AI tool, etc.). The actual build of a data platform can be a daunting process but you can improve your chances for a successful project by following tactical tips we have amassed over the years:

1. Buy in. Get all business and technical stakeholders on board before the project starts and keep them engaged during the project. This includes building a single team of consultants (if you are using them), the IT team, and various business teams (finance, accounting, marketing, operations, etc.).

2. Access. Line up access to the source systems for your project prior to starting the build phase. This is particularly important if you plan on leveraging consultants to build the platform as this access always takes longer than planned. Delays in access will delay your project.

3. Environments. If procuring hardware, ensure this process is completed prior to the start of the project. Having development, test, and production environments is highly recommended and we have found procurement & configuration always take longer than anticipated. Leveraging on demand cloud environments can help mitigate this risk.

4. Scope. Ensure all stakeholders are aware of what is in scope as well as what is out of scope

5. Build iteratively. Rather than building the entire platform and deploying it at the end of the project, build iteratively. Nothing beats real feedback and testing. Building the platform in phases allows users to get hands on with data early and provides an extended testing period for the new platform.

6. Validate. Enable business users to use the system as components are deployed iteratively and compare data from legacy platforms to data from the new platform. Identify discrepancies and trace causes back to the source.

    content: `This post sheds light on a critical question concerning AI: the whereabouts of data. Over the past two decades, the software industry has seen a surge in niche applications tailored to solve specific issues, prompting a shift away from all-encompassing ERP systems. While these niche apps address departmental needs effectively, the crucial aspect of data management often gets overlooked.

The rise of generative AI tools like Chat GPT, Claude, CoPilot, and Gemini has been remarkable, yet the true potential lies in leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning to extract valuable insights from data. However, with data scattered across various applications, the challenge arises in consolidating and utilizing it efficiently to drive informed decision-making.

Focusing solely on departmental optimization neglects the holistic needs of the enterprise, emphasizing the urgency for organizations to reclaim ownership of their dispersed data. CoPoint Data specializes in assisting companies in unlocking the full potential of advanced analytics and AI by streamlining and standardizing data for optimal utilization.

Without a comprehensive data strategy, training AI models on incomplete datasets risks veering off course and hindering progress. Embracing AI holds immense promise in enhancing organizational efficiency and effectiveness through actionable insights, but the initial priority lies in establishing a robust data foundation for meaningful utilization.

For organizations seeking guidance on navigating the AI landscape and harnessing the power of data, CoPoint Data offers strategic solutions and roadmaps tailored to drive success.`,
